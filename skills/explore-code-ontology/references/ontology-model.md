# Ontology model

The exporter uses RDF 1.1 Turtle and common W3C vocabularies. Its namespace is:

`https://battle-doll.github.io/code-ontology-explorer/schema#`

## Main node classes

- `Package`, `Module`
- `Class`, `Interface`, `Enum`, `Record`
- `Function`, `AsyncFunction`, `Method`, `AsyncMethod`
- `FrameworkAnnotation`, `Decorator`
- `ExternalType`, `ExternalModule`, `ExternalCallable`
- `FrameworkConcept`, `PipelineRole`

## Main relationships

- `DECLARES`
- `IMPORTS`
- `EXTENDS`, `IMPLEMENTS`
- `ANNOTATED_BY`, `DECORATED_BY`
- `INJECTS`, `DECLARES_BEAN`
- `MANAGED_AS`, `MAY_BE_PROXIED_BY`
- `CALLS`
- `HAS_PIPELINE_ROLE`

RDF predicate names are emitted in UpperCamelCase form, for example `co:AnnotatedBy`.

## Portability

`ontology.ttl` can be loaded into RDF 1.1-compatible stores such as Apache Jena, RDF4J, GraphDB, or Stardog. Loading and configuring those products is outside this plugin's v0.1 scope and may introduce separate licenses, services, ports, or resource requirements.

The JSON file is the bundled tool's operational index. Turtle is the interchange format. Preserve stable node URNs during migration, then map custom `co:` terms if the destination ontology uses different classes or predicates.

## Static-analysis limits

An edge means the analyzer found a static structural signal. It is not a trace, runtime call graph, vulnerability verdict, or proof that a Spring proxy or bean is active.
